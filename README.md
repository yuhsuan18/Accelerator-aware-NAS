# Accelerator-aware Neural Architecture Search for DCNNs


Propose an Accelerator-aware NAS method with Multiple Search Space
* Find efficient models on Eyeriss
* Find flexible architecture
* MobileNetV2-like: Low latency, high accuracy compared to MobileNetV2
* ResNet-like: High accuracy. After scaling on DIP, latency <  MobileNetV2 & V3
* Mixed: Various latency with -1.2% ~ -0.2% accuracy compared to ResNet-50
